        <p class="about">Our mission is to help companies of all sizes successfully implement powerful and easy-to-use open source Enterprise 
        Resource Planning (ERP) software to grow their business profitably.
        <br>
        Leonardo da Vinci once said: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Whether it is an object or technology, the 	
        simpler it is, the more it appeals to the human senses, and the better are its chances of being liked and adopted by 
        users. We also believe in the power of simplicity and strive tirelessly to innovate and build 
        technologically advanced solutions that solve our customer’s business problems in the most agile and simplest of ways. We 
        excel in creating value for all our customers by orchestrating the best of people, process and technology, and 
        delivering the most agile solutions that are configurable, extendible and scalable to meet their changing business needs.
        <br>
        Our belief - that technology should help businesses simplify their needs and not the other way around - has driven us to 
        build innovative solutions that are simple yet effective.<br><br><br>

        <h3>Boost Customer Engagement</h3>
        ERPS comes with a virtual number so that your future customers can reach you easily. When they call your 
                number, 
                they hear a professional greeting and intuitive IVR, which routes their calls to the right person. 
                <br>
                Handles high volume of calls, 100% up time and round the clock support. Quick resolution by expert team for any 
                issues 
          faced.</p>

                <h3>Project a Professional Image</h3>
                Whether you're a single-person company or a multinational conglomerate, customers expect responsive service. 
                With features such as automatic call-forwarding, voice messaging and call routing, MyVorace helps companies of all 				sizes handle incoming calls simply and seamlessly.</p>
            
        <p class="about">
            <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
            <h3>Never Miss a Potential Customer</h3>
 
			With MyVorace's call recording and tracking, you'll always know who tried to contact your company and when. You can 			
            then respond to those missed opportunities yourself or you can even distribute these valuable customer leads among 	
            your employees at the touch of a button. Crisis averted. Sale closed.

        <h3>Real Time Business Intelligence</h3>
 
			If you're interested in understanding exactly what's on your customers' minds, you'll be happy to know that both 
            incoming and outgoing calls are automatically recorded. You can then analyze calls to understand if there are common 
            issues that customers are facing or if there are things everyone loves about your products or services. That makes 
            improving customer satisfaction a breeze.
